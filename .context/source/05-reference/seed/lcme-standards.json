Information about such issues as the following are available, as appropriate, to the student and the medical school in order to inform the student's and the school's review of the experience prior to its approval: potential risks to the health and safety of patients, students, and the community; the availability of emergency care; the possibility of natural disasters, political instability, and exposure to disease; the need for additional preparation prior to, support during, and follow-up after the elective; the level and quality of supervision; any potential challenges to the code of medical ethics adopted by the home school."
