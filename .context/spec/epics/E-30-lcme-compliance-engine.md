**Feature:** F-14
**Estimated Sprints:** 1
**Sprint Assignment:** Sprint 39

## Definition of Done

- Compliance heatmap: 12 standards x element status (met/partial/unmet)
- Element drill-down showing full evidence chain
- Performance: <5 min per standard

## User Flows Enabled
- UF-23: LCME Compliance Reporting — partially enabled (computation + visualization)
