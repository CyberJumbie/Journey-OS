# S-IA-17-3: Framework Search

**Epic:** E-17 (Framework Browser UI)
**Feature:** F-08
**Sprint:** 3
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** S

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need to search across framework nodes by name or keyword so that I can quickly find specific standards, competencies, or objectives without manually browsing the tree.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Search input on framework list page and tree view page
- [ ] Search across: node name, description, framework_id
- [ ] Results grouped by framework with framework name as section header
- [ ] Each result shows: node name, framework, level, parent path
- [ ] Click result navigates to tree view with that node expanded and highlighted
- [ ] Debounced input: 300ms delay before query fires
- [ ] Minimum 2 characters to trigger search
- [ ] Empty results state with clear messaging
- [ ] Neo4j full-text index used for performant search
- [ ] 5 API tests: search endpoint, empty query, no results, cross-framework results, auth enforcement

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Service | apps/server | src/services/framework/framework-search.service.ts |
| Controller | apps/server | src/controllers/framework/framework-search.controller.ts |
| Components | packages/ui | src/components/search/framework-search.tsx, src/components/search/search-result-item.tsx |
| Tests | apps/server | src/services/framework/__tests__/framework-search.service.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-IA-17-1
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- Neo4j full-text index: `CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX frameworkSearch FOR (n:USMLE_System|USMLE_Discipline|LCME_Standard|...) ON EACH [n.name, n.description]`.
- Debounced search prevents excessive Neo4j queries during typing.
- Result highlighting: bold the matching substring in the result display.
- Parent path display helps distinguish nodes with similar names across frameworks.
