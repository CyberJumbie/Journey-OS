# S-F-23-4: Self-Review Mode

**Epic:** E-23 (Faculty Review UI)
**Feature:** F-10
**Sprint:** 13
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** S

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need to review my own generated questions with appropriate restrictions so that I can self-check work while maintaining review integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Self-review mode activated when reviewer is same as question generator
- [ ] Visual indicator: banner showing "Self-Review Mode" with different styling
- [ ] Restriction: self-reviewed approvals marked as `self_approved` (distinct from `approved`)
- [ ] `self_approved` items may require secondary review based on automation level config
- [ ] Self-reviewer cannot change critic scores (read-only in self-review)
- [ ] Comments still available for self-documentation
- [ ] Institution setting to enable/disable self-review entirely
- [ ] 5-8 API tests: self-review detection, restricted actions, self_approved status, institution toggle
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/review/self-review.types.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/review/self-review.service.ts` |
| View | apps/web | `src/components/review/SelfReviewBanner.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/review/self-review.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-F-23-1 (review queue exists)
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- Self-review is common in smaller programs where faculty numbers are limited
- `self_approved` status useful for audit reports — shows which items had independent review vs. self-review
- Auth check: compare `question.generated_by` with `request.user.id`
- Consider configurable policy: some institutions may allow self-review only for specific question types
- Self-review cannot change the automation level routing decision
