# S-U-16-3: USMLE Seed Data

**Epic:** E-16 (Framework Seeding)
**Feature:** F-08
**Sprint:** 1
**Lane:** universal (P0)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **platform engineer**, I need the USMLE framework seeded with 227 nodes in correct hierarchy so that curriculum mapping can reference organ systems, disciplines, physician tasks, and topics.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 227 USMLE nodes created across 4 hierarchy levels
- [ ] USMLE_System nodes seeded (e.g., Cardiovascular, Respiratory, etc.)
- [ ] USMLE_Discipline nodes seeded (e.g., Anatomy, Biochemistry, etc.)
- [ ] USMLE_Task nodes seeded (e.g., Health Promotion, Diagnosis, etc.)
- [ ] USMLE_Topic leaf nodes seeded under appropriate parents
- [ ] Hierarchical relationships: (USMLE_System)-[:CONTAINS]->(child nodes)
- [ ] Each node has: framework_id, name, description, level, sort_order
- [ ] Seed data stored in structured JSON/TS data files
- [ ] Running `pnpm kg:seed` includes USMLE seeding
- [ ] Node count verification: exactly 227 nodes after seeding
- [ ] 5 API tests: node count, hierarchy integrity, idempotency, unique constraints, relationship correctness

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Data | apps/server | src/services/seed/data/usmle-systems.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/usmle-disciplines.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/usmle-tasks.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/usmle-topics.data.ts |
| Service | apps/server | src/services/seed/usmle-seeder.service.ts |
| Tests | apps/server | src/services/seed/__tests__/usmle-seeder.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-U-16-4, S-IA-17-1
- **Blocked by:** S-U-16-1, S-U-16-2
- **Cross-epic:** S-IA-17-2 (tree view queries USMLE hierarchy)

## Notes
- USMLE hierarchy: System > Discipline > Task > Topic. Not all branches go 4 levels deep.
- Data sourced from USMLE Step 1/Step 2 CK content outlines.
- Use typed data arrays, not raw JSON, so TypeScript catches structural errors at compile time.
- sort_order field enables consistent display ordering in the Framework Browser UI.
