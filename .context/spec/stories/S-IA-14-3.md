# S-IA-14-3: ILO Management UI

**Epic:** E-14 (ILO & SLO CRUD)
**Feature:** F-07
**Sprint:** 5
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need a management interface for ILOs so that I can create, view, edit, and search institutional learning objectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ILO list page with table: columns for code, title, Bloom level, status, FULFILLS count, created date
- [ ] Search by title or code
- [ ] Filter by Bloom level, status (active/archived)
- [ ] Create ILO form: code, title, description, Bloom level selection
- [ ] Edit ILO inline or via modal
- [ ] Soft-delete with confirmation dialog (archive, not destroy)
- [ ] Controller endpoints: GET /ilos, POST /ilos, PATCH /ilos/:id, DELETE /ilos/:id
- [ ] 8-10 API tests for CRUD endpoints, validation, search, permission checks

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/ilo.controller.ts` |
| Route | apps/server | `src/routes/ilo.routes.ts` |
| Validation | apps/server | `src/middleware/ilo.validation.ts` |
| View - List | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/ILOManagement/ILOManagement.tsx` |
| View - Table | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/ILOTable.tsx` |
| View - Form | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/ILOForm.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/ilo.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-IA-14-1 (ILO model and repository must exist)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-01-3 (RBAC: institutional_admin role)

## Notes
- ILOManagement is an Organism containing ILOTable and ILOForm Molecules
- FULFILLS count column shows how many SLOs map to each ILO (read from junction data)
- Bloom level selector uses a dropdown with the 6 taxonomy levels
- Use design tokens for table styling, form inputs, status badges
- Custom error class: `DuplicateILOCodeError` for uniqueness violations
