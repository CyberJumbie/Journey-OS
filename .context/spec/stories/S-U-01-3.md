# S-U-01-3: RBAC Middleware

**Epic:** E-01 (Auth Infrastructure)
**Feature:** F-01
**Sprint:** 3
**Lane:** universal (P0)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **platform engineer**, I need role-based access control middleware so that API endpoints are protected based on the authenticated user's role and only authorized personas can access their designated resources.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] RbacMiddleware accepts allowed roles as constructor parameter
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden when user role not in allowed list
- [ ] Custom ForbiddenError class with role context in error payload
- [ ] RbacService defines permission matrix: role -> allowed resource actions
- [ ] SuperAdmin has access to all routes
- [ ] Institutional Admin scoped to own institution's resources
- [ ] Faculty scoped to assigned courses within institution
- [ ] Student scoped to enrolled courses
- [ ] Advisor scoped to assigned students
- [ ] Composable: `rbac.require('superadmin', 'institutional_admin')` pattern
- [ ] Institution scoping: middleware verifies `req.user.institution_id` matches resource
- [ ] 12 API tests: per-role access, denied access, multi-role routes, institution scoping, missing role, superadmin override, nested permission check, edge cases

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | src/auth/rbac.types.ts, src/auth/permissions.types.ts |
| Middleware | apps/server | src/middleware/rbac.middleware.ts |
| Service | apps/server | src/services/auth/rbac.service.ts |
| Errors | apps/server | src/errors/forbidden.error.ts |
| Tests | apps/server | src/middleware/__tests__/rbac.middleware.test.ts, src/services/auth/__tests__/rbac.service.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-SA-04-1, S-IA-06-1, S-SA-07-1, S-IA-17-1
- **Blocked by:** S-U-01-2
- **Cross-epic:** All persona-specific API stories depend on RBAC

## Notes
- Pattern: `router.get('/institutions', authMiddleware.handle, rbac.require('superadmin'), controller.list)`.
- Permission matrix should be defined declaratively (data, not code) for easy auditing.
- Institution scoping is critical: an institutional_admin must never access another institution's data.
- Custom error classes only per architecture rules.
- Constructor DI for RbacService into RbacMiddleware.
