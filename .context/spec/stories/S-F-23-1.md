# S-F-23-1: Review Queue List Page

**Epic:** E-23 (Faculty Review UI)
**Feature:** F-10
**Sprint:** 13
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need a review queue page with filterable table and status indicators so that I can efficiently triage and prioritize questions awaiting review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Paginated table displaying questions routed to review
- [ ] Columns: title/stem preview, question type, course, priority, status, critic composite score, assigned reviewer, date
- [ ] Filter by: status (pending/in_review/revised), course, priority level, question type, date range
- [ ] Sort by: priority (default), date, composite score, course
- [ ] Status indicators: color-coded badges for pending (yellow), in_review (blue), revised (green)
- [ ] Bulk select for batch status changes
- [ ] Claim/unclaim functionality for self-assignment
- [ ] Empty state with helpful messaging when queue is clear
- [ ] 8-12 API tests: list endpoint, filtering, sorting, pagination, claim/unclaim
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/review/queue.types.ts` |
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/review/review-queue.controller.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/review/review-queue.service.ts` |
| View | apps/web | `src/app/(dashboard)/faculty/review/page.tsx`, `src/components/review/ReviewQueueTable.tsx`, `src/components/review/QueueFilters.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/review/review-queue.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-F-23-2, S-F-23-3, S-F-23-4
- **Blocked by:** S-F-22-2 (router determines what reaches review)
- **Cross-epic:** S-F-22-2 (Sprint 13 router)

## Notes
- Queue scoped by faculty assignment: faculty see items for their courses + unassigned items in their department
- Priority badge: P1 (red), P2 (orange), P3 (yellow), P4 (blue), P5 (gray)
- Real-time queue updates via SSE (new items appearing) — not Socket.io (Socket.io is for presence only)
- Table component built with shadcn/ui DataTable pattern
- Consider keyboard shortcuts for power users: j/k navigate, c claim, Enter open detail
