# S-IA-14-4: SLO Management UI

**Epic:** E-14 (ILO & SLO CRUD)
**Feature:** F-07
**Sprint:** 5
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need a management interface for SLOs so that I can create, view, edit, and search course-level learning objectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SLO list page scoped to selected course: columns for code, title, Bloom level, status, FULFILLS link status, created date
- [ ] Course selector to switch between courses
- [ ] Search by title or code
- [ ] Filter by Bloom level, status (active/archived), FULFILLS status (linked/unlinked)
- [ ] Create SLO form: code, title, description, Bloom level, course association
- [ ] Edit SLO inline or via modal
- [ ] Soft-delete with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Controller endpoints: GET /courses/:id/slos, POST /slos, PATCH /slos/:id, DELETE /slos/:id
- [ ] 8-10 API tests for CRUD endpoints, course scoping, validation, permission checks

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/slo.controller.ts` |
| Route | apps/server | `src/routes/slo.routes.ts` |
| Validation | apps/server | `src/middleware/slo.validation.ts` |
| View - List | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/SLOManagement/SLOManagement.tsx` |
| View - Table | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/SLOTable.tsx` |
| View - Form | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/SLOForm.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/slo.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-IA-14-2 (SLO model and repository must exist)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-01-3 (RBAC: institutional_admin or course_director role)

## Notes
- SLOManagement is an Organism containing SLOTable and SLOForm Molecules
- FULFILLS link status column shows whether SLO has an approved FULFILLS to an ILO
- Course selector dropdown at top of page scopes all data
- Use design tokens for table styling, form inputs, status badges
- Custom error class: `DuplicateSLOCodeError` for uniqueness violations within course scope
- Faculty (Course Directors) can also access this UI for their own courses
