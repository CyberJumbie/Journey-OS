# S-AD-45-5: Student Alert View

**Epic:** E-45 (Advisor Cohort Dashboard & Interventions)
**Feature:** F-21
**Sprint:** 38
**Lane:** advisor (P5)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **medical student flagged as at-risk**, I need to see a notification with my risk areas and recommended study actions so that I can take proactive steps to improve before it becomes critical.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Alert banner on student dashboard when active risk flag exists
- [ ] Alert severity matches risk level: yellow (moderate), orange (high), red (critical)
- [ ] Alert content: "Areas needing attention" with top struggling concepts listed
- [ ] Recommended actions: specific study recommendations (practice X, review Y)
- [ ] Link to practice session pre-configured with recommended concepts
- [ ] Dismiss alert (marks as acknowledged, does not delete flag)
- [ ] Alert reappears if risk level escalates after dismissal
- [ ] Notification hook: in-app notification when new flag is generated
- [ ] Privacy: student sees their own flags only, no cohort comparison
- [ ] Accessible: alert uses ARIA role="alert" for screen readers

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-AD-44-4 (risk flags), S-F-34-1 (notification infrastructure)
- **Cross-epic:** Notification delivery via E-34, risk data from E-44

## Notes
- Alert banner is non-blocking: student can dismiss and continue using dashboard.
- Recommended actions generated by the same recommendation engine (S-AD-45-2) but student-facing language.
- Privacy: API endpoint filters to current user's flags only (enforced server-side).
- Tone: supportive and encouraging, not alarming. "You're close to mastering X" not "You're failing at X".
