# S-F-08-4: Course List & Detail Views

**Epic:** E-08 (Course CRUD & Hierarchy)
**Feature:** F-04
**Sprint:** 4
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need filterable course list and detail views so that I can quickly find courses and see their full configuration and hierarchy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Course list page with table view: columns for code, title, program, CD, status, academic year
- [ ] Filter by: program, academic year, status (active/archived)
- [ ] Search by course title or code
- [ ] Pagination with configurable page size
- [ ] Course detail page showing: basic info, hierarchy tree, CD info, SLO summary (placeholder)
- [ ] Edit inline or navigate to edit form from detail view
- [ ] Controller endpoints: GET /courses (list with filters), GET /courses/:id (detail with hierarchy)
- [ ] 8-10 API tests for list filtering, pagination, detail fetch, 404 handling

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/course.controller.ts` (extend) |
| Route | apps/server | `src/routes/course.routes.ts` (extend) |
| View - List | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/CourseList/CourseList.tsx` |
| View - Detail | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/CourseDetail/CourseDetail.tsx` |
| View - Table | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/CourseTable.tsx` |
| View - Filters | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/CourseFilters.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/course.controller.test.ts` (extend) |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-F-08-1 (course model and repository must exist)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-01-3 (RBAC for endpoint protection)

## Notes
- CourseList is an Organism containing CourseTable (Molecule) and CourseFilters (Molecule)
- Detail view uses a tree component to visualize Section > Session hierarchy
- Use design tokens for table styling, never hardcoded hex/font/spacing
- Pagination follows cursor-based pattern for consistent results
- Course detail includes a placeholder section for SLOs (populated in E-09)
