# S-F-39-4: Help & FAQ Pages

**Epic:** E-39 (Templates & Help)
**Feature:** F-18
**Sprint:** 16
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** S

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need help and FAQ pages with searchable documentation so that I can find answers to common questions about the platform without external support.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Help page with categorized documentation sections
- [ ] FAQ accordion with expandable question/answer pairs
- [ ] Categories: Getting Started, Generation, Review, Templates, Item Bank, Analytics
- [ ] Search functionality: client-side text search across all FAQ entries
- [ ] Contextual help links: pages link to relevant FAQ section
- [ ] Content managed as static MDX or structured JSON (no CMS needed)
- [ ] Responsive layout with sidebar navigation on desktop
- [ ] 3-5 API tests: FAQ list endpoint, search, category filter
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| View | apps/web | `src/app/(dashboard)/help/page.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/help/faq/page.tsx`, `src/components/help/FAQAccordion.tsx`, `src/components/help/HelpSearch.tsx`, `src/components/help/HelpSidebar.tsx` |
| Content | apps/web | `src/content/help/getting-started.mdx`, `src/content/help/faq.json` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/help/faq.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** none
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- FAQ content can be seeded from common support questions during beta
- MDX allows rich content (code blocks, images, callouts) without a CMS
- Search uses simple client-side text matching — no need for full-text search engine
- Consider adding a "Was this helpful?" feedback mechanism on each FAQ entry
- Contextual help: `?` icon on pages opens relevant FAQ section in a drawer
- shadcn/ui Accordion component for FAQ items
