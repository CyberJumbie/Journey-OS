# S-ST-41-1: Practice Launcher

**Epic:** E-41 (Adaptive Practice UI)
**Feature:** F-19
**Sprint:** 32
**Lane:** student (P4)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **medical student**, I need to configure and launch an adaptive practice session by selecting concept scope and session parameters so that I can focus my practice on specific areas.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Practice launcher page at `/practice/launch`
- [ ] Concept scope selection: by USMLE system, by course, or all concepts
- [ ] Multi-select: choose one or more systems/courses
- [ ] Session configuration: question count (10, 25, 50, custom), time mode (timed/untimed)
- [ ] Timed mode: configurable per-question timer (60s, 90s, 120s)
- [ ] Preview: estimated session duration based on question count and timer
- [ ] Mastery summary for selected scope (from BKT service)
- [ ] "Start Session" button creates session record and navigates to first question
- [ ] Session state stored server-side with session ID
- [ ] API endpoint: POST /api/practice/sessions (create session)
- [ ] Validation: at least one concept scope selected, question count 1-100

| Types | packages/types | `src/practice/session-config.types.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/modules/practice/services/practice-session.service.ts` |
| Controller | apps/server | `src/modules/practice/controllers/practice-session.controller.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-ST-41-2, S-ST-41-3, S-ST-41-4
- **Blocked by:** S-ST-40-4 (adaptive item selection algorithm)
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- Session creation calls Python adaptive service to precompute initial item queue.
- Scope selection tree mirrors USMLE taxonomy; use Neo4j graph for hierarchy.
- Session record stored in Supabase `practice_sessions` table.
- Timer mode affects how the question view component behaves (S-ST-41-2).
