# S-F-18-1: LangGraph.js Pipeline Scaffold

**Epic:** E-18 (LangGraph.js Generation Pipeline)
**Feature:** F-09
**Sprint:** 6
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** L

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need a 14-node LangGraph.js pipeline scaffold with state management so that the AI question generation system has a structured, observable execution graph for producing high-quality assessment items.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LangGraph.js StateGraph defined with 14 nodes (11 generation + 3 review)
- [ ] Pipeline state schema typed: `GenerationState` with question draft, vignette, stem, distractors, rationale, scores, metadata
- [ ] Node routing logic: conditional edges between generation and review phases
- [ ] Entry point node accepts generation parameters (question type, difficulty, SLO, concept scope)
- [ ] Checkpoint persistence for resumable generation (LangGraph checkpointer)
- [ ] Pipeline factory with constructor DI for LLM provider, embedding service, config
- [ ] Error handling: custom `PipelineExecutionError`, `NodeTimeoutError` classes
- [ ] Graph visualization export for debugging (mermaid diagram generation)
- [ ] 12-15 API tests: graph construction, state transitions, node routing, error paths, checkpoint save/restore
- [ ] Named exports only, no default exports, TypeScript strict

| Types | packages/types | `src/generation/pipeline.types.ts`, `src/generation/state.types.ts` |
| Model | apps/server | `src/models/generation-state.model.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/generation/pipeline.service.ts`, `src/services/generation/pipeline-factory.service.ts` |
| Graph | apps/server | `src/services/generation/graph/graph-definition.ts`, `src/services/generation/graph/node-registry.ts` |
| Config | apps/server | `src/config/pipeline.config.ts` |
| Errors | apps/server | `src/errors/pipeline.errors.ts` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/generation/pipeline.service.test.ts`, `src/tests/generation/graph-definition.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-F-18-2, S-F-18-3, S-F-18-4
- **Blocked by:** S-F-12-1 (concepts available), S-IA-14-2 (SLOs exist), S-U-01-3 (RBAC)
- **Cross-epic:** S-F-12-1 (Sprint 5 concepts), S-IA-14-2 (Sprint 5 SLOs)

## Notes
- LangGraph.js uses `StateGraph` from `@langchain/langgraph` — not LangChain's legacy `AgentExecutor`
- State must be immutable between nodes; use LangGraph's annotation-based state schema
- 11 generation nodes: init, context-fetch, vignette-gen, stem-gen, distractor-gen (x3 for A/B/C wrong + correct), rationale-gen, metadata-tag, format-output
- 3 review nodes: validation-check, quality-score, self-correction
- Conditional edge after quality-score: if score < threshold, route to self-correction, else to format-output
- Pipeline must support both single and batch invocation (batch in E-20)
- Target: <500ms to first token via streaming, <45s full generation cycle
