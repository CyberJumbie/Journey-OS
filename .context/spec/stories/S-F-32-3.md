# S-F-32-3: Course Cards

**Epic:** E-32 (Faculty Dashboard)
**Feature:** F-15
**Sprint:** 8
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need course overview cards with quick action buttons so that I can see the status of each course I teach and jump directly to generation, review, or coverage analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CourseCard molecule: course title, code, term, question count, coverage percentage, status badge
- [ ] Quick action buttons: Generate (→ workbench), Review (→ review queue), Coverage (→ heatmap)
- [ ] Course cards grid: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- [ ] Cards sorted by: most recent activity (default), alphabetical, coverage (ascending for gap focus)
- [ ] Visual coverage indicator: mini progress bar on each card
- [ ] Course status badge: Active (green), Draft (yellow), Archived (gray)
- [ ] Empty state: "No courses assigned" with link to contact admin
- [ ] 8-10 API tests: rendering, card content, quick actions, sorting, responsive layout, empty state
- [ ] Named exports only, TypeScript strict, design tokens only

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-F-08-1 (course model), S-U-01-3 (auth)
- **Cross-epic:** S-F-08-1 (Sprint 4 course model)

## Notes
- Data fetched from `/api/courses?faculty_id=X` — returns courses where user is faculty or course director
- Coverage percentage sourced from latest coverage snapshot for each course
- Quick action routes: Generate → `/workbench?course=<id>&mode=generate`, Review → `/review?course=<id>`, Coverage → `/coverage?course=<id>`
- Mini progress bar reuses the same color scale as the heatmap: red/yellow/green
- Sort control: dropdown above the grid, persisted in localStorage
- Course Director sees all courses in their program; faculty sees only assigned courses
