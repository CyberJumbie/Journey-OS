# S-F-10-1: Upload Dropzone Component

**Epic:** E-10 (Upload & Storage)
**Feature:** F-05
**Sprint:** 4
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need a drag-and-drop upload component with file validation so that I can easily upload course materials in supported formats.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dropzone component accepts drag-and-drop and click-to-browse
- [ ] Accepted file types: PDF (.pdf), PowerPoint (.pptx), Word (.docx)
- [ ] File size validation: max 50MB per file
- [ ] MIME type validation on client side before upload
- [ ] Upload progress bar per file
- [ ] Multiple file upload support (up to 10 files per batch)
- [ ] Error states: wrong file type, file too large, upload failure
- [ ] Upload service client that calls server API with multipart/form-data
- [ ] 8-10 API tests for upload endpoint validation, file type rejection, size limit

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/content/upload.types.ts` |
| View - Dropzone | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/UploadDropzone/UploadDropzone.tsx` |
| View - Progress | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/UploadProgressItem.tsx` |
| View - Atoms | packages/ui | `src/components/atoms/DropArea.tsx`, `src/components/atoms/FileIcon.tsx` |
| Service (client) | apps/web | `src/services/upload.client.ts` |
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/upload.controller.ts` |
| Route | apps/server | `src/routes/upload.routes.ts` |
| Validation | apps/server | `src/middleware/upload.validation.ts` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/upload.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-F-10-2
- **Blocked by:** S-F-08-1 (content is attached to courses)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-01-3 (RBAC for upload permission)

## Notes
- UploadDropzone is an Organism with DropArea (Atom) and UploadProgressItem (Molecule)
- Client-side MIME check is defense-in-depth; server also validates
- Server uses multer middleware for multipart parsing
- Custom error classes: `InvalidFileTypeError`, `FileSizeLimitError`
- Dropzone shows file type icons (FileIcon atom) based on extension
- Use design tokens for dropzone border, hover states, progress bar colors
