# S-IA-37-4: Lint Alert Integration

**Epic:** E-37 (KaizenML Linting & Golden Dataset)
**Feature:** F-17
**Sprint:** 15
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** S

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need push notifications when new lint issues are detected so that critical data quality problems are addressed promptly without checking the dashboard manually.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Alert triggered on lint run completion when critical findings > 0
- [ ] Alert triggered on golden dataset drift detection
- [ ] Alert payload: summary of findings count by severity, link to report
- [ ] Alert channel: in-app notification (prepares for E-34 notification system)
- [ ] Interim implementation: Supabase `notifications` table insert + SSE push
- [ ] Configurable alert threshold: minimum severity to trigger notification
- [ ] Alert suppression: don't re-alert for previously seen findings
- [ ] 5-8 API tests: alert trigger conditions, suppression logic, threshold config
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/kaizen/alert.types.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/kaizen/lint-alert.service.ts` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/kaizen/lint-alert.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-IA-37-1 (lint engine produces findings to alert on)
- **Cross-epic:** S-F-34-1 (Sprint 19 notification model — interim solution until then)

## Notes
- Interim notification: direct Supabase insert until E-34 notification system is built
- When E-34 is available, refactor to use NotificationService instead of direct insert
- Alert suppression uses finding fingerprint: hash of (ruleId + affectedNodeId)
- SSE push to admin dashboard for real-time alert display
- Consider email notification as future enhancement (not in scope for this story)
- Drift alerts are higher priority than lint alerts — consider separate urgency level
