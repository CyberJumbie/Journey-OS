# S-F-22-2: Review Router

**Epic:** E-22 (Critic Agent & Review Router)
**Feature:** F-10
**Sprint:** 13
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need a review router that automatically routes questions based on critic scores so that high-quality items are fast-tracked, poor items are rejected, and borderline items reach human reviewers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Router accepts `CriticResult` and applies threshold-based routing
- [ ] Three outcomes: `auto_approve` (composite ≥ 4.2), `route_to_review` (2.5-4.2), `auto_reject` (< 2.5)
- [ ] Thresholds configurable per institution and per question type
- [ ] Auto-approve writes `approved` status + audit trail
- [ ] Auto-reject writes `rejected` status with critic justification as reason
- [ ] Route-to-review assigns to review queue with priority based on score
- [ ] Priority assignment: lower composite score = higher review priority
- [ ] Routing decision logged with full provenance (critic scores, thresholds applied, outcome)
- [ ] Custom error class: `RoutingError`
- [ ] 8-12 API tests: each routing outcome, threshold edge cases, config override, priority assignment, audit trail
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/review/router.types.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/review/review-router.service.ts` |
| Repository | apps/server | `src/repositories/review-queue.repository.ts` |
| Errors | apps/server | `src/errors/router.errors.ts` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/review/review-router.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-F-23-1
- **Blocked by:** S-F-22-1 (critic agent exists)
- **Cross-epic:** S-F-23-1 (Sprint 13 review queue)

## Notes
- Thresholds are not hard boundaries — institutions may want asymmetric thresholds (stricter auto-approve, lenient auto-reject)
- Auto-approved items still appear in review history for audit purposes
- Review queue priority: 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest), derived from composite score buckets
- Status transitions: `validated` → `scoring` → `auto_approved` | `pending_review` | `auto_rejected`
- Consider notification trigger on `route_to_review` outcome (integrates with E-34 in Sprint 19)
