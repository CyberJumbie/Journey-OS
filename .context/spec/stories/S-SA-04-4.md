# S-SA-04-4: Rejection Workflow

**Epic:** E-04 (Institution Lifecycle)
**Feature:** F-02
**Sprint:** 3
**Lane:** superadmin (P1)
**Size:** S

## User Story
As a **SuperAdmin**, I need to reject an institution application with a reason so that the applicant is notified and the decision is recorded for audit.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reject action requires a reason (text field, min 10 chars)
- [ ] Application status transitions: pending -> rejected
- [ ] Rejection reason stored in application record
- [ ] Rejection timestamp and rejecting SuperAdmin ID recorded
- [ ] Notification email sent to applicant with rejection reason
- [ ] Rejected applications remain visible in queue with 'rejected' filter
- [ ] Re-application: applicant can submit a new application after rejection
- [ ] 5 API tests: successful rejection, missing reason, status transition, email dispatch mock, auth enforcement

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Service | apps/server | src/services/institution/rejection.service.ts, src/services/email/rejection-email.service.ts |
| Controller | apps/server | src/controllers/institution/rejection.controller.ts |
| Tests | apps/server | src/controllers/institution/__tests__/rejection.controller.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-SA-04-2
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- Reuses ApplicationReviewService from S-SA-04-2 for status updates.
- Rejection email should be professional and include next steps (re-apply, contact support).
- Rejection reason is audit-critical; never allow deletion of rejection records.
- Service extends the same approval controller file or sits alongside it in the same route group.
