# S-IA-37-3: Lint Results UI

**Epic:** E-37 (KaizenML Linting & Golden Dataset)
**Feature:** F-17
**Sprint:** 15
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need a lint results page showing errors with severity, affected nodes, and suggested fixes so that I can triage and resolve data quality issues efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lint report list: paginated table of past lint runs with date, total findings, severity breakdown
- [ ] Report detail view: grouped findings by rule with severity badges
- [ ] Each finding shows: rule name, severity, affected node(s) with links, message, suggested fix
- [ ] Filter by: severity level, rule category, date range
- [ ] Sort by: severity (default), date, affected node count
- [ ] Aggregate stats: total critical/warning/info counts, trend sparkline
- [ ] Quick action: "Mark as resolved" to dismiss a finding
- [ ] Export lint report as CSV
- [ ] 8-12 API tests: report list, report detail, filtering, resolution marking, export
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/kaizen/lint-ui.types.ts` |
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/kaizen/lint-report.controller.ts` |
| View | apps/web | `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/kaizen/page.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/admin/kaizen/[reportId]/page.tsx`, `src/components/kaizen/LintReportTable.tsx`, `src/components/kaizen/FindingCard.tsx`, `src/components/kaizen/SeverityBadge.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/kaizen/lint-report.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-IA-37-1 (lint engine produces reports to display)
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- Severity badge colors: critical (red), warning (amber), info (blue) — use design tokens
- Affected node links navigate to the relevant entity page (concept, SLO, question)
- Trend sparkline shows finding counts over last 30 days
- "Mark as resolved" adds `resolved_by` and `resolved_at` to finding record
- CSV export includes all finding fields for offline analysis
- Consider grouping findings by affected entity for node-centric triage view
