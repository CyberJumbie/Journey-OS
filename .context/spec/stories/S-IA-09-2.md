# S-IA-09-2: Weekly Schedule View

**Epic:** E-09 (Course SLO Linking & Scheduling)
**Feature:** F-04
**Sprint:** 4
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need a weekly schedule view for courses so that I can see session timing and material slots organized by week.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Weekly calendar component showing sessions for a selected course
- [ ] Week selector: navigate between weeks of the academic term
- [ ] Session cards display: title, time, section, assigned materials count
- [ ] Material slot indicators showing upload status (empty, pending, processed)
- [ ] Controller endpoint: GET /courses/:id/schedule?week=N returns sessions with material counts
- [ ] Responsive layout: works on desktop and tablet viewports
- [ ] 8-10 API tests for schedule fetch, week filtering, empty week handling

## Dependencies

## Notes
- WeeklySchedule is an Organism containing SessionCard Molecules and WeekSelector Molecule
- Sessions are grouped by day_of_week within the selected week
- Material slot indicator is a visual badge: grey (empty), yellow (pending), green (processed)
- Use design tokens for calendar grid spacing and colors
- Week number is derived from session.week_number field set during course creation
