# S-IA-17-4: Setup Wizard Step

**Epic:** E-17 (Framework Browser UI)
**Feature:** F-08
**Sprint:** 3
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** S

## User Story
As a **newly onboarded Institutional Admin**, I need a framework import step in the setup wizard so that I can confirm which educational frameworks my institution uses during initial configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework selection step in Institutional Admin onboarding flow
- [ ] Checkbox list of all 8 available frameworks with descriptions
- [ ] Pre-selected defaults: USMLE, LCME (most common for US medical schools)
- [ ] Selected frameworks stored in institution settings
- [ ] At least one framework must be selected (validation)
- [ ] Selected frameworks determine which framework cards appear in browser
- [ ] Skip option with warning: "You can configure frameworks later in settings"
- [ ] Confirmation summary before completing the step

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | src/institution/institution-settings.types.ts |
| Service | apps/server | src/services/institution/institution-settings.service.ts |
| View | apps/web | src/app/(protected)/onboarding/steps/framework-setup.tsx |
| Components | packages/ui | src/components/forms/framework-checklist.tsx |
| Tests | apps/server | src/services/institution/__tests__/institution-settings.service.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-IA-17-1, S-U-02-3 (onboarding screens)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-02-3 (this step integrates into the onboarding flow)

## Notes
- This is a view-layer component that integrates into the onboarding flow from S-U-02-3.
- Institution settings table stores selected_frameworks as a JSON array of framework IDs.
- The framework browser (S-IA-17-1) should filter cards based on institution's selected frameworks.
- DualWriteService: institution settings update in Supabase first, then Neo4j institution node properties.
