# S-ST-42-3: Readiness Tracker

**Epic:** E-42 (Student Dashboard)
**Feature:** F-20
**Sprint:** 27
**Lane:** student (P4)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **medical student**, I need to see my Step 1 readiness compared to historical passing benchmarks so that I can gauge whether I am on track for the exam.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Readiness score (0-100) displayed as a gauge or circular progress
- [ ] Benchmark line showing historical passing threshold
- [ ] Confidence interval visualization (e.g., "75% chance of passing")
- [ ] Comparison with cohort average (anonymized, opt-in)
- [ ] Trend mini-chart showing readiness score over last 4 weeks
- [ ] Tooltip explaining how readiness score is calculated
- [ ] Historical benchmark data seeded from USMLE pass-rate statistics
- [ ] Service layer computes readiness from aggregate mastery data
- [ ] Loading state with skeleton

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | `src/student/readiness.types.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/modules/student/services/readiness-tracker.service.ts` |
| Controller | apps/server | `src/modules/student/controllers/student-dashboard.controller.ts` (extend) |
| View | apps/web | `src/components/student/readiness-tracker.tsx` |
| Component | apps/web | `src/components/student/readiness-gauge.tsx` |
| Component | apps/web | `src/components/student/readiness-trend-chart.tsx` |
| API Tests | apps/server | `src/modules/student/__tests__/readiness-tracker.service.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-ST-42-1 (dashboard page exists)
- **Cross-epic:** Benchmark data is static seed; real IRT-calibrated readiness comes with S-ST-40-2

## Notes
- Readiness calculation formula: weighted average of system mastery scores against USMLE blueprint weights.
- Historical benchmarks can be hardcoded initially; later driven by IRT calibration data.
- Gauge component should be reusable for other contexts (e.g., course readiness).
