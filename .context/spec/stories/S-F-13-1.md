# S-F-13-1: Concept Review Queue UI

**Epic:** E-13 (Concept Review & Verification)
**Feature:** F-06
**Sprint:** 5
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** L

## User Story
As a **Faculty member (Course Director)**, I need a review queue showing extracted concepts pending verification so that I can approve, reject, or edit them before they become part of the verified curriculum map.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review queue page listing all unverified SubConcepts for a course
- [ ] Filterable by: source content, confidence score range, enrichment status
- [ ] Sortable by: confidence score, extraction date, name
- [ ] Per-concept actions: Approve, Reject (with reason), Edit (name/description)
- [ ] Concept detail panel showing: name, description, source chunk text, confidence score, StandardTerm mappings
- [ ] Review statistics banner: total, approved, rejected, pending counts
- [ ] Controller endpoints: GET /courses/:id/concepts?status=unverified, PATCH /concepts/:id/review
- [ ] Pagination for large concept lists
- [ ] 12-15 API tests for list, filter, approve, reject, edit actions, permission checks
- [ ] 1 E2E test: full review flow (view queue, approve concept, verify status change)

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/conceptReview.controller.ts` |
| Route | apps/server | `src/routes/conceptReview.routes.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/conceptReview.service.ts` |
| View - Queue | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/ConceptReviewQueue/ConceptReviewQueue.tsx` |
| View - Card | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/ConceptReviewCard.tsx` |
| View - Detail | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/ConceptDetailPanel.tsx` |
| View - Stats | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/ReviewStatsBanner.tsx` |
| View - Filters | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/ConceptFilters.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/conceptReview.controller.test.ts` |
| E2E | apps/web | `e2e/concept-review.spec.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-F-13-3
- **Blocked by:** S-F-12-1 (concepts must be extracted), S-F-12-4 (TEACHES relationships must exist)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-01-3 (RBAC: course_director role required)

## Notes
- ConceptReviewQueue is an Organism; ConceptReviewCard, ConceptDetailPanel, ReviewStatsBanner are Molecules
- Only Course Directors and Institutional Admins can review concepts (RBAC enforced)
- Reject action requires a reason string (stored in audit trail)
- Edit action updates SubConcept name/description and triggers re-embedding for dedup consistency
- Use design tokens for status badges: blue (pending), green (approved), red (rejected)
- Detail panel opens as a slide-over or modal showing the source chunk context
