# S-IA-17-1: Framework List Page

**Epic:** E-17 (Framework Browser UI)
**Feature:** F-08
**Sprint:** 3
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need a framework management page showing all available educational frameworks as cards with summary stats so that I can see which frameworks are seeded and ready for curriculum mapping.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Framework list page at /institution/frameworks (Institutional Admin only)
- [ ] Card grid layout: one card per framework (8 total)
- [ ] Each card shows: framework name, description, node count, hierarchy depth, icon
- [ ] Cards sorted by: node count descending (USMLE first)
- [ ] Click card navigates to hierarchy tree view (S-IA-17-2)
- [ ] FrameworkService queries Neo4j for framework stats (count per label)
- [ ] Loading skeleton while stats are fetched
- [ ] Empty state if no frameworks seeded yet
- [ ] RBAC: Institutional Admin and SuperAdmin access
- [ ] 8 API tests: list endpoint, stats accuracy, auth enforcement, empty state, role restriction, card data structure, Neo4j query performance, sort order

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Types | packages/types | src/frameworks/framework-summary.types.ts |
| Service | apps/server | src/services/framework/framework.service.ts |
| Controller | apps/server | src/controllers/framework/framework.controller.ts |
| Routes | apps/server | src/routes/institution/framework.routes.ts |
| View | apps/web | src/app/(protected)/institution/frameworks/page.tsx |
| Components | packages/ui | src/components/cards/framework-card.tsx, src/components/layout/card-grid.tsx |
| Tests | apps/server | src/controllers/framework/__tests__/framework.controller.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-IA-17-2, S-IA-17-3
- **Blocked by:** S-U-01-3, S-U-16-4 (need seeded framework data to browse)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-16-3, S-U-16-4 (seeded data displayed here)

## Notes
- Neo4j query for stats: `MATCH (n) WHERE n.framework IS NOT NULL RETURN n.framework AS framework, count(n) AS count`.
- Card component is an organism in Atomic Design; reusable for other card-grid views.
- Design tokens for card styling: border-radius, shadow, padding from packages/ui theme.
- Consider caching framework stats (they change only when re-seeding).
