# S-IA-09-3: Course Oversight Dashboard

**Epic:** E-09 (Course SLO Linking & Scheduling)
**Feature:** F-04
**Sprint:** 4
**Lane:** institutional_admin (P2)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As an **Institutional Admin**, I need an oversight dashboard across all courses so that I can monitor curriculum status, SLO coverage, and course health at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard page showing all courses for the institution in summary cards
- [ ] Summary metrics per course: SLO count, FULFILLS coverage %, content uploads count, processing status
- [ ] Filter by: program, academic year, status
- [ ] Sort by: coverage %, course name, last updated
- [ ] Drill-down: click course card to navigate to course detail
- [ ] Controller endpoint: GET /admin/courses/overview returns aggregated metrics
- [ ] 8-10 API tests for overview fetch, filtering, sorting, empty state

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/courseOverview.controller.ts` |
| Route | apps/server | `src/routes/courseOverview.routes.ts` |
| Service | apps/server | `src/services/courseOverview.service.ts` |
| View - Dashboard | apps/web | `src/components/organisms/CourseOverview/CourseOverview.tsx` |
| View - Summary Card | apps/web | `src/components/molecules/CourseSummaryCard.tsx` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/courseOverview.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-F-08-1 (course data must exist)
- **Cross-epic:** S-U-01-3 (RBAC: institutional_admin role required)

## Notes
- Dashboard aggregates data from courses, SLOs, FULFILLS relationships, and content records
- Coverage % = (SLOs with approved FULFILLS / total SLOs) * 100
- CourseSummaryCard is a Molecule with a mini progress bar for coverage
- Use design tokens for card layout, spacing, progress bar colors
- Performance: use a single aggregation query rather than N+1 per-course fetches
