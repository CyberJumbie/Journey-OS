**Stories:** 4
**Epics:** E-44

## Execution Order (by lane priority)

| # | Story | Title | Lane | Size |
|---|-------|-------|------|------|
| 1 | S-AD-44-1 | GNN Risk Model | advisor | L |
| 2 | S-AD-44-2 | Trajectory Analysis Service | advisor | M |
| 3 | S-AD-44-3 | Root-Cause Tracing | advisor | M |
| 4 | S-AD-44-4 | Risk Flag Generation | advisor | M |

## Sprint Goals
- Build GNN-based risk prediction model using student interaction and knowledge graph features
- Deliver trajectory analysis service to detect declining performance patterns early
- Implement root-cause tracing to identify specific concepts driving risk and generate actionable risk flags

## Entry Criteria
- Sprint 32 exit criteria complete (adaptive practice UI operational)
- Sufficient student practice data and knowledge graph structure for GNN training

## Exit Criteria
- GNN risk model produces per-student risk scores with configurable thresholds
- Trajectory analysis detects statistically significant performance declines
- Root-cause tracing identifies at-risk concepts; risk flags persist and are queryable
