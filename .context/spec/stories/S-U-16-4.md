# S-U-16-4: Remaining Framework Seeds

**Epic:** E-16 (Framework Seeding)
**Feature:** F-08
**Sprint:** 1
**Lane:** universal (P0)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **platform engineer**, I need the remaining 7 frameworks (LCME, ACGME, AAMC, UME, EPA, Bloom, Miller) seeded with ~265 nodes so that curriculum alignment and accreditation tools have complete reference data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LCME: 105 nodes — Standards + Elements with (LCME_Standard)-[:HAS_ELEMENT]->(LCME_Element)
- [ ] ACGME: 27 nodes — Core Competencies + Sub-competencies
- [ ] AAMC: 55 nodes — Domains with hierarchy
- [ ] UME: 55 objectives + 6 bridge nodes linking to other frameworks
- [ ] EPA: 13 Entrustable Professional Activities
- [ ] Bloom: 6 cognitive levels (Remember through Create)
- [ ] Miller: 4 competence levels (Knows, Knows How, Shows How, Does)
- [ ] All use MERGE-based idempotent seeding
- [ ] Each framework seeder class extends BaseSeeder
- [ ] Total node count after full seed: ~492 (227 USMLE + ~265 remaining)
- [ ] 8 API tests: one node-count verification per framework
- [ ] Running `pnpm kg:seed` seeds all 8 frameworks in correct order

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Data | apps/server | src/services/seed/data/lcme.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/acgme.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/aamc.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/ume.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/epa.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/bloom.data.ts, src/services/seed/data/miller.data.ts |
| Service | apps/server | src/services/seed/lcme-seeder.service.ts, src/services/seed/acgme-seeder.service.ts, src/services/seed/aamc-seeder.service.ts, src/services/seed/ume-seeder.service.ts, src/services/seed/epa-seeder.service.ts, src/services/seed/bloom-seeder.service.ts, src/services/seed/miller-seeder.service.ts |
| Tests | apps/server | src/services/seed/__tests__/framework-seeders.test.ts |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** S-IA-17-1
- **Blocked by:** S-U-16-1, S-U-16-2, S-U-16-3
- **Cross-epic:** S-IA-17-1 (framework browser needs all frameworks seeded)

## Notes
- UME bridge nodes create cross-framework relationships: (UME_Objective)-[:MAPS_TO]->(ACGME_Competency).
- Bloom and Miller are flat lists (no hierarchy), simplest seeders.
- LCME standards are numbered (1-12) with sub-elements; maintain official numbering in framework_id.
- Seed order matters: USMLE first (largest), then LCME, ACGME, AAMC, UME (depends on ACGME for bridges), EPA, Bloom, Miller.
