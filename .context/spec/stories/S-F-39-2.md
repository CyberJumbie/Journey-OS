# S-F-39-2: Template Management Page

**Epic:** E-39 (Templates & Help)
**Feature:** F-18
**Sprint:** 16
**Lane:** faculty (P3)
**Size:** M

## User Story
As a **Faculty member**, I need a template management page to list, create, edit, and preview templates so that I can organize my generation presets visually.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Template list: card grid showing template name, description, question type, sharing level, last modified
- [ ] Create template: modal/page form with all configurable fields
- [ ] Edit template: pre-populated form, saves as new version
- [ ] Preview panel: shows a sample of what the template configuration would produce
- [ ] Delete with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Filter by: sharing level, question type, course
- [ ] Search by template name
- [ ] Sharing toggle: change visibility level from template card
- [ ] Empty state with "Create your first template" CTA
- [ ] 8-12 API tests: list with filters, create, edit, delete, search
- [ ] TypeScript strict, named exports only

## Implementation Layers
| Layer | Package | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| View | apps/web | `src/app/(dashboard)/faculty/templates/page.tsx`, `src/components/template/TemplateCard.tsx`, `src/components/template/TemplateForm.tsx`, `src/components/template/TemplatePreview.tsx`, `src/components/template/TemplateFilters.tsx` |
| Controller | apps/server | `src/controllers/template/template-list.controller.ts` |
| Tests | apps/server | `src/tests/template/template-list.controller.test.ts` |

## Dependencies
- **Blocks:** none
- **Blocked by:** S-F-39-1 (template model and CRUD exist)
- **Cross-epic:** none

## Notes
- Card grid layout with responsive columns: 3 on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- Template form reuses the difficulty distribution component from batch config (S-F-20-2)
- Preview generates a mock question outline (not a real LLM call) based on template params
- Sharing level badge: lock icon (private), group icon (course), building icon (institution), globe icon (public)
- shadcn/ui Card, Dialog, and Form components
- Design tokens for card shadows, borders, spacing
